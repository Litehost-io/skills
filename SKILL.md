# Litehost Connect

Base URL: `https://connect.litehost.io` · Agent guide: https://connect.litehost.io/llms.txt

Helper: `scripts/litehost.sh` (in this skill's folder). Use it whenever you can run bash: it keeps
the API key in a file between commands and never prints it.

---

## Step 1 — Pick the path (do this before anything else)

Run `scripts/litehost.sh session` first.

| Result | Path |
|---|---|
| `"status":"success"` | **A. Signed in.** Use `scripts/litehost.sh api …` for every call. Never sign in again. |
| `NO_SAVED_KEY` and the user just wants a link | **B. Publish without signing in.** Follow `actions/temp-project.md`. |
| `NO_SAVED_KEY` and the user wants you to manage their projects | **C. Sign in once.** Follow `actions/otp-sign-in.md`, then path A. |
| `API_KEY_INVALID` / `API_KEY_EXPIRED` | Run `scripts/litehost.sh forget`, then B or C. |

Rules that prevent the "asked for a code again" problem:

- **Never start a sign-in because a command failed.** Read the error `code` and follow its
  `nextStep`. Only `API_KEY_INVALID` / `API_KEY_EXPIRED` (after `forget`) lead to signing in.
- **Never rely on `export LITEHOST_API_KEY=…`.** Each command usually runs in a new shell, so the
  variable is gone on the next call and every request fails with 401. The helper reads the key
  from `~/.config/litehost/credentials.json` on every call.
- **Request a code once per sign-in.** If you request again while a code is open, nothing new is
  sent. A wrong code (`OTP_INVALID`) means the user mistyped: ask them to re-check, never request
  a new one.
- A key from sign-in renews while in use. Once saved, it keeps working across sessions.

No bash (e.g. Windows without WSL)? Use the curl examples in the action files, read the key from
`LITEHOST_API_KEY` or the credentials file in **every** command, and follow the same rules.

---

## Step 2 — Do the task

Map the user's intent to one action file, read it, and follow it. Every curl example in the action
files maps to the helper: `curl -X METHOD https://connect.litehost.io/PATH -H "Authorization: …" ARGS`
becomes `scripts/litehost.sh api METHOD /PATH ARGS` (same `-F` / `-d` / `-H "Content-Type…"` args).

| User says | Action file |
|---|---|
| "share this", "quick link", "preview this", "publish this" (no key) | `actions/temp-project.md` |
| "sign in", "log in", "connect my account" | `actions/otp-sign-in.md` |
| "deploy this", "host this", "publish this" (signed in) | `actions/create-project.md` |
| "update my site", "push new version", "redeploy", "replace content" | `actions/replace-project.md` |
| "rename", "change slug", "make private", "set password", "set expiry", "SEO" | `actions/update-project.md` |
| "list my projects", "what do I have hosted" | `actions/list-projects.md` |
| "project details", "project status" | `actions/get-project.md` |
| "deploy history", "versions" | `actions/deployment-history.md` |
| "delete project" | `actions/delete-project.md` |
| "archive", "free up a slot" | `actions/archive-project.md` |
| "unarchive", "restore" | `actions/unarchive-project.md` |
| "domains", "custom domain" | `actions/domains.md` |
| "workspaces", "organize projects" | `actions/workspaces.md` |
| "my plan", "quota", "how much space" | `actions/get-user.md` |

Before creating, claiming or restoring a project while signed in, call `GET /v1/user` and check
quotas (`utils/quotas.md`).

## Plans

New accounts get Pro free for 7 days. On Free, the API allows: listing, viewing, creating and
deleting projects, claiming temp projects, and `GET /v1/user`. Pushing new versions, changing
settings, archive/unarchive, domains and workspaces need a paid plan (`FREE_TIER_RESTRICTED`).
That error means the key is fine: tell the user and link https://litehost.io/dashboard?upgrade=plans.
Do not sign in again.

---

## File detection

1. Single HTML file, or a folder with HTML → static site
2. ZIP with one HTML file → static site (that file is the homepage)
3. ZIP with several HTML files → set `zipIndexHtmlPath`. Try `index.html`, then `dist/index.html`; if
   still ambiguous, ask the user (the error lists `htmlPaths`).
4. ZIP without HTML, or PDFs, images, documents → file bundle
5. Force file-bundle mode with `asFileBundle=true`

---

## Output

After every publish or update, give the user:
1. The live `url`
2. For temp projects, the `claimUrl` and that it expires in 15 minutes unless they open it
3. The `projectId` (needed for later updates)

---

## Errors

Every error response has `code`, `error` and `nextStep`. Follow `nextStep`. Full table:
`utils/errors.md`.

## When NOT to use this skill

- General web development questions unrelated to hosting
- Other hosting providers (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, …)
- Local development servers
- DNS outside Litehost custom domains
- Billing: send the user to https://litehost.io/dashboard
